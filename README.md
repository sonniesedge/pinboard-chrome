# pinboard-chrome

This will be a chrome extension that will open a new page with all your unread pinboard links shown. 

It'll be more useful than the actual site, as you'll be able to exclude tags (twitter fills too much of my timeline) and you can show screenshots or favicons to more easily identify things (pure text doesn't work well for people like me).
